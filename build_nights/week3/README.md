# Build Night 3 - 10/03/2022



## Tasks:
1) IMPORTANT: Fill the new When2Meet form by the end of the build night if you haven't. I will try to get an exact meeting time by tomorrow.
2) Find more open source software (via Github, or any other source you find) - complex but not overly complex
- Should aim to have 4-5 software options in case the first two are rejected.
3) Discuss presentation/analysis ideas (?) 

## Homework:
- Meeting this week with Dr. Hamlen - discuss the software options we have and when/how to access his vulnerability scanner
- Make sure you know the basics of what a CVE is and the common cyber-attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).

Note: There is a trial so maybe one of us has to make an account to view this during the 7day trial.
