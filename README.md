# finding-security-vulnerabilities
You will learn the basics of cybersecurity penetration testing and put your hacking skills to the test: our team will work together to find security vulnerabilities in a pre-existing, real-world, open-source software project. The ultimate goal is to be able to demonstrate a significant vulnerability and submit a pull request to patch it.
